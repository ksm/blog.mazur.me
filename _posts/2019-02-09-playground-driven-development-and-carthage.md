title:  "How to get Playground Driven Development working with Carthage"
---

I introduced [Playground Driven Development](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep21-playground-driven-development) on the last project I worked on. It sped up my development and forced me to write view controllers in a decoupled way. But before I was able to reap the benefits of PDD I hit a roadblock: Xcode Playgrounds kept throwing a `Couldn't look up symbols` error, because it couldn't see [Carthage](https://www.github.com/Carthage/Carthage)-built dependencies. Here's how to fix this issue.

## Identifying the problem

Initially I wasn't sure what the source of my Playgrounds problem was, so I made a [sample PDD project](https://github.com/ksm/Habits) without Carthage. Next I installed Carthage and added a single dependency[^1]. This reproduced the problem:

## Fixing the *couldn't look up symbols* issue

I knew Playgrounds were missing some symbols, and I knew this was Carthage related. It became clear that Carthage supplied dependencies weren't being seen by Playgrounds. What wasn't so obvious to me is how to fix this issue in a way that wouldn't require any kind of Xcode project restructuring.

I reached out to the iOS community with the sample project that reproduced the problem, and it turned out that [Logan Moseley](https://github.com/loganmoseley) was having the same problem. Within a day Logan figured out the simple fix I was searching for. Thank you Logan! Here are the steps:

1. Select Xcode â†’ Project Settings â†’ Targets â†’ Your Main Target
2. Click on the Build Phases tab
3. Add a Copy Files phase
4. Select Products Directory as the Destination
5. Drag all Carthage-supplied frameworks in from the project navigator's frameworks group
6. Clean and re-build the project, open Playgrounds and enjoy Playground Driven Development

Or better yet, have a look at [an image of the fix](/assets/2019-02-09-playground-driven-development-and-carthage-logan-fix.png) that Logan made.

We're done. Playground Driven Development with Xcode and Carthage should now work. ðŸ’«

I'm currently writing another blog post on how Playground Driven Development improves your development experience and codebase. Stay tuned.

[^1]: The [master](https://github.com/ksm/Habits/tree/master) branch has a self-contained Xcode project with working PDD. The [carthage](https://github.com/ksm/Habits/tree/carthage) branch installs Carthage and shows the problem (you still have to run `carthage bootstrap`). The fix is on [carthage-fix](https://github.com/ksm/Habits/tree/carthage-fix).
